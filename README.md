# Predict-NCAA-March-Madness

This is all of the data I have hand collected since the 2017 March Madness tournament. Therefore all of the post 2017 data is pre-tournament advanced tables, while pre 2017 is end of year data of the tournament teams. I have the code where I clean the data in here, as well as where I calculate the average advanced stats per minute played for the whole team. This then is calculated into my model which has outperformed ALL the other models out there like kenpom, 538 (RIP), etc. five of the eight (barely missed this year after the FL win over Auburn in the Final Four) years I have used it. 

The most recent R file is tourny 2025 model work pt3.R, but the most recent final model work is done in the csv file analyzeAllWithInj_2025_with_SOS.csv.
